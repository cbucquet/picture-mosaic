# Picture Mosaic
Welcome to Picture Mosaic! This is a python project used to turn a picture into a mosaic of smaller pictures!  
Kinda like this: [ADD EXAMPLES PICTURES]

## Requirements
This project was built using python 3.11 but it might work with versions >3.10 (because we use argparse)  
Picture Mosaic uses different modules such as Pillow, and all of them are present in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/cbucquet/picture-mosaic.git

  ```
2. Download dependecies using:
  ```
